This is my project of deep learning where i have created a neural network to predict the number of bikes required

I have Implemented :- 
Feed Forward Implementation
Back Propagation
Gradient Descent Method of error loss
and many more

you can check out all the things
all are well explained 

as well the data i have used for training is also attached in this.

If my code as help you understand the basic of deep learning 
please hit a like.
